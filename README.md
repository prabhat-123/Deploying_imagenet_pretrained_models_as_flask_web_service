# Deploying_imagenet_pretrained_models_as_flask_web_service

This repository mainly focuses on deployment of imagenet model which was trained on VGG-19 architecture using Flask as a web service.
ImageNet is a huge collection of image database with more than 14 million images of more than thousand unique classes. AI researcher Fei-Fei Li began working on the idea for ImageNet in 2006. At a time when most AI research focused on models and algorithms, Li wanted to expand and improve the data available to train AI algorithms. Imagenet dataset was collected in collaborative research from Standford and Princeton University professors and students.

## How ImageNet Dataset was created?

Here is a link to the video of one of the research Fei-Fei-Li where she explains about the idea behind the creation of imagenet dataset and how it got created.

Firstly, I run my notebook in google colab to download the VGG-19 pretrained model and then I save the model weights in .h5 file format.
